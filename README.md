Algorithms from Algorithms for Optimization, Kochenderfer &amp; Wheeler (2019)

Here will reside the algorithms presented in Kochenderfer & Wheeler (2019). This is not meant contain all the algorithms they have, but rather the ones I have needed at some point.

Sometimes I modify the algorithms to make them able to run in the Julia versions I use. Sometimes, I modify them to add some functionality.

One of the authors maintains a comprehensive repo: https://github.com/tawheeler/alg4opt_test.jl
Jupyter notebooks are also available: https://github.com/sisl/algforopt-notebooks

Errata for the book is here: https://github.com/sisl/algforopt-errata
